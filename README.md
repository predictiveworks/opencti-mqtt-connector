# OpenCTI Mqtt Connector

This **OpenCTI** connector listens to the platform's event stream (SSE), extracts indicators
and observables and sends them to a MQTT Broker.

This connector contributes to PredictiveWorks. Cy(I)IoT initiative that aims to use threat
intelligence events and device or sensor readings side-by-side.
